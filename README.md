# Sudoku
For the course of Data Structures in the University of Prishtina, I was assigned to code the game of Sudoku. For those who don't know, Sudoku is a game with numbers, you start with a few values in a 9x9 table and you have to write the missing values in a way that there are no duplicates horizontally, vertically or in the 3x3 boxes.

# The Architecture
I tried my best to apply the MVC architecture in this project but I'm quite sure I've made a few mistakes while using it. However though, this project contains a Model class, a View class and a Controller class which has another inner class for the MouseListener called SudokuListener. I've also created a file for an enum class called STATE which represents the menu states.

# Showcase
This is what the Sudoku table looks like. I've also created a Main Menu screen but for the sake of keeping this readme clean I will not post it.
